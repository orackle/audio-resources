**Cheat**
- **Dorian** (minor + raised 6): soulful, groovy; funk/jazz.
- **Mixolydian** (major + b7): bluesy major; dominant vibes.
- **Lydian** (major + #4): floating, dreamy; film score pads.
- **Phrygian** (minor + raised 2): dark, brooding; melancholy.
- **Ionian** (major): bright, clear; pop/rock.
- **Aeolian** (minor): sad, melancholic; ballads.
- **Locrian** (minor + b5): dark, brooding; melancholy.


**Tip**
- Land on the “character” note (6 in Dorian, b7 in Mixo, #4 in Lydian) to sell the mode.
- Use **relative minor** to find the tonic (e.g., Cm = Am).
